# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project utilizes formulas and tools in Excel to format data and create pivot tables and pivot charts to organize and display data. Using these tools allows the analyst to examine the data and present it in a simplified chart for others to understand the analyst's findings.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to measure milestones (i.e. successes, failures, etc.) over time as well as measure outcomes in comparison to goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
My analysis was performed by following the steps laid out in Challenge 1. These steps required me to organize the dataset and create new columns including 'Parent Category', 'Subcategory', 'Date Created Conversion', 'Date Ended Conversion', and 'Years'. Using these new columns I was able to organize the data into pivot tables that selected smaller, specified demographics of data to create charts with that displayed the data. These charts were utilized to visually summarize findings within the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Converting the original launch and delivered dates presented as a challenge for me initially, but this was prior to seeing the instructions with the formula laid out to change the units the date was previously measured in. Without the directions, this formula would not be intuitive to know or figure out by working with the data on your own.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
After reviewing the chart, the successful and failed outcomes of the theater category were roughly the same when the launch date was in December. A second conclusion I have drawn is that May launch dates seem to produce the highest success rates.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The greatest percentages of success occurred in ranges under 5000 or greater than 50000. Percentages of cancellations are generally lower for all ranges than percentages of successes or failures.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of this dataset is the data spans over a wide range of time and therefore likely will exclude variances in the data without analysis on a smaller scale. Another limitation in this dataset is although you may see trends in the graphs, understanding why those trends are occurring cannot be explained in the graphs and the instance of a certain trend may or may not be caused by different reasons each year.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Line and column graphs were utilized with this dataset; other suitable graphs/charts for this dataset include bar, area, and combination graphs. Graphs/charts and tables could have also been created to determine results based on deliverable dates as well, or a utilization of a graph/chart that analyzed the trends of outcomes from launch to delivered dates.
